-- Low-stock alerts are created by the inventory deduction trigger and delivered
-- by the send-sms-alert Edge Function through the WhatsApp service.
-- Configure a Supabase Database Webhook for INSERT on sms_alert_logs to call
-- the send-sms-alert function. The webhook is the asynchronous delivery step;
-- the inventory/order transaction itself remains fast and non-blocking.
